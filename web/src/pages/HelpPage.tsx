            and evening are two doses). Use <strong>Move to as needed</strong> or{' '}
            <strong>Move to daily schedule</strong> to switch types without re-adding a
            medication. Refill and

          A <strong>perfect day</strong> means you logged every scheduled dose that day.
          Your current streak counts consecutive perfect days. Today still counts as in
          progress until the day ends — missing doses after that breaks the streak. On{' '}
