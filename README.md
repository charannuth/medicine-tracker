## Vision

Dr. Dose aims to be the central hub between patients, pharmacies, and healthcare providers — making it simple to know what to take, when to take it, and when to refill, while reducing accidental double-dosing.

## Current status

**Web v1** — in active use for daily adherence, wellness, safety checks, and optional health tracking (cycle, med progress). React + Vite frontend, Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL backend, deployed on Vercel.

| Target | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Web (v1) | **Available** (`web/`) — [deploy guide](docs/DEPLOY.md) |
| Database | Migrations **002–016** — see [docs/MIGRATIONS.md](docs/MIGRATIONS.md) |
| iOS / Android | Planned (after push + shared logic) |
| Pharmacy integrations | Long-term |

**Stack:** [React](https://react.dev) · [Vite](https://vite.dev) · [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (Auth + PostgreSQL + Storage) · [RxNorm](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/index.html) (drug name lookup)

---

## Native mobile & long-term (planned)

The **web app is complete for browser use**; native iOS/Android is not released yet. Planned work (push when app is closed, offline dose queue, shared logic with web, widgets, more trackers) is in **[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)**. Web reminders require the tab to stay open or recently active — see [WEB_APP.md → Reminders](docs/WEB_APP.md#my-account-account).

---

## Data model (Supabase)

### `medications`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `name` | Medication name |
| `dose_pills`, `dose_mg` | Text dose labels (scheduled meds need at least one; PRN may use daily cap instead) |
| `schedule_type` | `scheduled` or `as_needed` |
| `schedule_times` | Array of 24h times, e.g. `["08:00","20:00"]` |
| `max_doses_per_day`, `prn_amount_hints`, `prn_symptom_hints` | PRN limits and UI presets |
| `medication_route`, `medication_form` | Route/form for safety copy and PRN defaults |
| `tracking_sync` | e.g. `hrt` to mirror doses into Tracking |
| `notes` | Optional |
| `pills_remaining` | Optional integer |
| `start_date`, `end_date` | Schedule window (`end_date` optional) |
| `user_id` | Owner (RLS) |

### `dose_logs`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `medication_id`, `user_id` | References |
| `taken_on` | Calendar date (user timezone) |
| `schedule_time` | Which daily slot was logged |
| `taken_at` | Timestamp |
| `logged_amount` | What was taken (especially PRN) |
| `prn_symptoms`, `prn_reason`, `prn_notes` | PRN check-in context |

**Unique constraint:** `(medication_id, taken_on, schedule_time)` — prevents duplicate logs for the same slot.

### `wellness_profiles` / `wellness_logs`

Per-user baseline (sleep habits, substance use, symptom focus) and one **daily log per calendar day** (sleep, energy, appetite, exercise, symptoms, notes). Migration `006_wellness.sql`.

### `medical_records`

One row per user: allergies, conditions, blood type, notes, demographics, `height_unit` / `weight_unit` preferences. Migrations `008`, `009`, `016`.

### Tracking tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `user_trackers` | Enabled module IDs per user |
| `cycle_settings`, `cycle_periods`, `cycle_day_logs` | Cycle tracking |
| `tracker_dose_events` | Dose logs mirrored into trackers (e.g. HRT) |

Migration `010_tracking.sql` (+ `014`, `015` for cycle enhancements).

### Migrations (run in order)

Full checklist, verification SQL, and troubleshooting: **[docs/MIGRATIONS.md](docs/MIGRATIONS.md)**.

Summary:

1. `supabase/schema.sql` — bootstrap `medications` + `dose_logs`
2. `supabase/migrations/002` … `016` — wellness, avatars, medical records, PRN, tracking, cycle, unit prefs

See [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md) for Auth and API keys.

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A free [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project

### Setup

1. **Database & auth** — [docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md](docs/SUPABASE_SETUP.md)
2. **Run migrations** — SQL Editor: `schema.sql` then `002` → `016` ([MIGRATIONS.md](docs/MIGRATIONS.md))
3. **Environment:**

```bash
cp web/.env.example web/.env
# VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
# VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

4. **Run locally:**

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL Vite prints).

### Deploy (Vercel)

Step-by-step: **[docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)**

1. Import repo on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) — set **Root Directory** to `web` (see `web/vercel.json`)
2. Env vars: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
3. Supabase → **Authentication** → add production URL to **Site URL** and **Redirect URLs**

### Resume later (local dev)

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

No need to run Supabase locally; keep `web/.env` with your API keys.

### Build

```bash
cd web
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## Scripts (`web/`)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |

---

## Roadmap

Shipped features and planned phases (mobile push, shared logic, HRT/weight trackers, integrations): **[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)**.

**Live demo:** Deploy to Vercel with env vars from Supabase; add production URL to Supabase Auth redirect allowlist ([DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md)).

---

## Development log (setup)

After cloning, run once:

```bash
./scripts/install-githooks.sh
```

Each `git commit` then appends its subject to the [Development log](#development-log) at the top of this file (same commit, via `post-commit` amend). To skip once: `SKIP_DEVLOG=1 git commit …`

Manual entry: `./scripts/append-dev-log.sh "Your summary"`.
